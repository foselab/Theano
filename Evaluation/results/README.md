The content of each file is described in the following:

- unboundedResults_completeness.csv: contains the results related to the completeness check executed with the unbounded technique

- unboundedResults_consistency.csv: contains the results related to the consistency check executed with the unbounded technique

- boundedResults_completeness.csv: contains the results related to the completeness check executed with the bounded technique

- boundedResults_consistency.csv: contains the results related to the consistency check executed with the bounded technique


- boundedResults_consistency_smaller.csv: contains the additional experiments executed with smaller models and the bounded technique for the consistency check

- AnalysisOfUnboundResults.m: enables to process the results and the statistics that are part of our paper related to the unbounded experiments. After running the script select 1 for the completeness analysis, and 2 for the consistency analysis

- AnalysisOfBoundResults.m: enables to process the results and generate the plots and the statistics that are part of our paper related to the bounded experiments. After running the script select 1 for the completeness analysis, and 2 for the consistency analysis

- AnalysisOfBoundResultsSmaller.m: enable to process the results concerning the additional experiments executed to evaluate the consistency check
