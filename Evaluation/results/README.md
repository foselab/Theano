- boundedResults_completeness.csv: contains the results related to the completeness check executed with the bounded technique

- boundedResults_consistency.csv: contains the results related to the consistency check executed with the bounded technique

- boundedResults_consistency_smaller.csv: contains the additional experiments executed with smaller models and the bounded technique for the consistency check

- AnalysisOfBoundResults: enables to process the results and generate the plots and the statistics that are part of our paper. After running the script select 1 for the completeness analysis, and 2 for the consistency analysis

- AnalysisOfBoundResultsSmaller: enable to process the results concerning the additional experiments executed to evaluate the consistency check
